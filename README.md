# Project Setup and Instructions

This guide will help you set up and run the project. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth installation and migration process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) – [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v6 or higher) – Installed along with Node.js
- **Sequelize CLI** – Install globally or locally if not already installed.

## Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

To install all the necessary packages for the project, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

### 2. Modify Sequelize Configuration

Next, update the Sequelize configuration to match your environment. Locate the following file:

```bash
config/sequelize.ts
```

In this file, update the database connection details like:

- **Username**
- **Password**
- **Database Name**
- **Host**
- **Dialect**

Ensure that these values match your local database setup or the credentials for your development environment.

### 3. Modify User Login Credentials

If the project requires specific user login credentials, update them accordingly in the authentication-related files or configuration files, based on where they are stored.

### 4. Run Migrations

To set up the database tables, run the Sequelize migration command. This will create the necessary tables in the database.

```bash
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

After running this command, verify that the respective tables have been created in your database.

### 5. Verify Tables

Once the migration is successful, you can use any database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.) to verify that the tables have been properly migrated into your database.

### 6. Start the Project

Now that everything is set up, you can start the project using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application on the configured port (default is usually `http://localhost:3000` unless specified otherwise).

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: If you encounter any connection issues, double-check the database credentials in the `config/sequelize.ts` file.
- **Migration Errors**: Ensure that your database is running, and the Sequelize CLI is correctly configured to point to the right environment.

## Additional Notes

- **Sequelize CLI**: If you haven't installed Sequelize CLI globally, you can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g sequelize-cli
  ```
  
- **Environment Variables**: If the project uses environment variables for sensitive data (such as database credentials), ensure you have set them up correctly in an `.env` file or in your environment.

Feel free to modify any of the steps to better suit your project's structure or specific configuration.
